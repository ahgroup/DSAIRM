<h3>A few general notes</h3>&#13;
<ul><li><p>Some of the tasks below (and in future apps) are fairly open-ended. The idea is that these tasks give you something to get started, but you should feel free to explore the simulations any way you want. Play with them, query them, go through iterations of thinking what you expect, observing it, and if discrepancies occur, figure out why. Essentially, the best way to use these apps is to <em>do your own science/research</em> with them.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>You might find for some parameter settings that numbers for bacteria/immune response/virus/cells/etc. drop below 1 (and possibly rebound later). If the units of our model are assumed to be in number of pathogen/cells, this of course is biologically not reasonable. Numbers less than 1 is an artifact of the underlying differential equation model. All ODE models (and the discrete time model we consider here) have that problem. A ‘hacky’ solution is to monitor the simulation and if a quantity drops below 1, set it to 0 or stop the simulation. A cleaner solution is to treat all entities (virus, cell) as discrete units and allow them to only change in integer steps (in a probabilistic manner). This approach will be discussed in the “Model stochasticity” app. For most apps, neither approach is taken, so you’ll see numbers less than 1. That’s ok for the purpose we use the apps here. Just be careful if you use these kinds of models in your research you might need to pay attention to this issue.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>This and most other simulations/apps do not have natural time units (unless specifically stated). You could, therefore, assume that your model runs in units of days or minutes/hours/weeks/months…, based on what’s most suitable for the system you want to study. You have to make sure that all your parameters are in the right time units. Always make sure to check if a given simulation can handle different time units or assumes specific ones. In general, I specify for each “What to do” section what kind of units I have in mind for the different tasks.</p></li>&#13;
</ul><p><strong>The tasks below are described in a way that assumes everything is in units of days (rate parameters, therefore, have units of inverse days). If any quantity is not given in those units, you need to convert it first (e.g. if it says a cell lives for a week, you need to convert it to 7 days, then take the inverse if you want a death rate, which is what usually goes into the model).</strong></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div id="task-1" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 1:</h3>&#13;
<p>Start with the following parameter settings in your model:</p>&#13;
<ul><li>100 initial bacteria, an initial immune response strength of 1, a simulation time of 100 (which we assume to be days)</li>&#13;
<li>Assume bacteria grow at a rate of 1 per day, the carrying capacity is 10<sup>5</sup> and they live for about 2 days (the inverse of the lifespan is the rate of death)</li>&#13;
<li>Assume the immune response is activated at a rate of 10<sup>-4</sup>, kills bacteria at a rate of 10<sup>-4</sup> and decays at a rate of 2 per day.</li>&#13;
<li>Only run the continuous time model. Therefore, the value for the time-step <em>dt</em> for the discrete model does not matter, you can leave it as is. Plot both x- and y-axes on a linear scale.</li>&#13;
</ul><p>Run the simulation, see what you get. You should see some oscillations and then the system settles down, with about bacteria and immune response at the end of the simulation at around 19996 and 3003.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div id="task-2" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 2:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Switch the plotting to have x-axis, y-axis or both plotted on a log scale.</li>&#13;
<li>Leave all other settings as before.</li>&#13;
<li>Note that while the look of the plot changes a lot, nothing has changed about the underlying simulation. The results are exactly the same in each case, only plotted differently. This is something to be aware of when you see plots in papers or produce your own. The best plot to use is the one that shows results of interest in the clearest form. Usually, the x-axis is linear and the y-axis is either linear or logarithmic.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-3" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 3:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Go back to both linear scales for plotting.</li>&#13;
<li>Set ”Models to run" now to ‘both’, which runs and shows both the continuous-time and discrete-time models.</li>&#13;
<li>Start with a discrete-time step of 0.01.</li>&#13;
<li>Leave all other settings as before.</li>&#13;
</ul><p>Run the simulation, see what you get. You should see the results from the 2 models essentially on top of each other and barely distinguishable.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div id="task-4" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 4:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Now try different values for <em>dt</em>.</li>&#13;
<li>Leave all other settings as before.</li>&#13;
</ul><p>You should notice that as <em>dt</em> gets larger, the differences between discrete-time and continuous-time models increase. At a time step above 0.1, the results start to look very different. Once you go about around 0.5 for the time-step, it becomes so large that for these parameter settings, the simulation ‘crashes’ and you get an error message.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div id="task-5" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 5:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Set <em>dt</em> to 0.6.</li>&#13;
<li>Leave all other settings as before.</li>&#13;
<li>Run the simulation. It should not work, you should get an error message.</li>&#13;
<li>Now play with the bacteria growth rate parameter and see for what values you can get the discrete-time simulation to work again.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-6" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 6:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Turn off the discrete-time simulation, set everything back as in task 1.</li>&#13;
<li>What do you expect to see if you now change the bacteria growth rate from 1 to 2? Think about your expectations, then run the simulation to see what you get. If your see something you didn’t expect, or didn’t know what to expect, try to make sense of the results.</li>&#13;
<li>Play around with the bacteria growth rate, try different values and see how it affect the results.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-7" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 7:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Set everything back as in task 1.</li>&#13;
<li>Now repeat what you did in the previous task, but this time investigate how changes in the immune response death rate parameter affect results.</li>&#13;
<li><strong>Make sure to always go through the iterative ‘think about expectations -&gt; run simulation -&gt; update understanding’ process (i.e. ‘do science’ with the model).</strong></li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-8" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 8:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Set everything back as in task 1.</li>&#13;
<li>Set y-axis to log for the plot.</li>&#13;
<li>Set immune response death rate to 0.1.</li>&#13;
</ul><p>You should get a plot where bacteria numbers drop to below 1 and take on fractional values (e.g. 10<sup>-4</sup> or less). Contemplate what that means. This is one of the draw-backs of ODE based models, and we’ll revisit this topic in the stochastic apps.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div id="task-9" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 9:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Go crazy :) change any parameters you want to change, see how it affects the results.</li>&#13;
<li>While going crazy, remember to continue to think about what you are doing and what you are seeing and what it all means…</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
