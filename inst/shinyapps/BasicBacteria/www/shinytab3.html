<h2>What to do</h2>&#13;
<div id="task-1" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 1:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Run the simulation with a population size of 1000, 1 initially infected host, simulation duration 100 days, recovery rate gamma=0.5 per day, and infectiousness beta=0.001. You will get an outbreak of some - currently unspecified - infectious disease.</li>&#13;
<li>Record the number and fraction of susceptible/infected/recovered remaining at the end of the outbreak.<br/></li>&#13;
<li>From the graph, get a (rough) estimate of the day at which the outbreak peaks.</li>&#13;
<li>Contemplate the fact that the outbreak ends even though there are still a good number of susceptible remaining, i.e. not everyone got infected.</li>&#13;
<li>Run the simulation again, with the same values you just had. Does anything change? Why (not)?</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-2" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 2:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Double the value of the transmission rate, beta. Leave everything else the same.</li>&#13;
<li>What do you expect to get for the number/fraction of S/I/R at the end of the outbreak and the time at which the outbreak peaks?</li>&#13;
<li>Run the simulation with the doubled transmission rate, record the same values (final S/I/R and outbreak peak) as above.</li>&#13;
<li>Compare your expectations with the results. How do they agree/disagree? Does it make sense? Anything surprising happening?</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-3" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 3:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Now, double the rate of recovery (gamma), leave everything as in #2.</li>&#13;
<li>How do you expect the results to change? (Try to make your prediction as precise/quantitative as you can)</li>&#13;
<li>Run the simulation with these new parameter settings, record the same values as above.</li>&#13;
<li>Compare your expectations with the results. How do they agree/disagree? Does it make sense? Anything surprising happening?</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-4" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 4:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Now, double the number of susceptibles (i.e. the population size), leave everything as in #3.</li>&#13;
<li>How do you expect the results to change?</li>&#13;
<li>Run the simulation with these new parameter settings, record the same values as above.</li>&#13;
<li>Compare your expectations with what results. How do they agree/disagree? Does it make sense? Anything surprising happening?</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-5" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 5:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Keep playing around with changing any of the parameters and starting conditions.</li>&#13;
<li>Every time, think about what you expect to get, then run the simulation, compare your expectations with the results. Then make sense of it.</li>&#13;
<li>What is the minimum and maximum number of outbreaks you can get? Why is that?</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
