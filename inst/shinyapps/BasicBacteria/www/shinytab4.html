<h2>Further Information</h2>&#13;
<ul><li>This app (and all others) are structured such that the Shiny part (the graphical interface you see and the server-side function that goes with it) calls an underlying R script which runs the simulation for the model of interest and returns the results.</li>&#13;
<li>For this app, the underlying function running the simulation is called <code>simulate_introduction.R</code>. You can call this function directly, without going through the shiny app. Type <code>?simulate_introduction</code> into the R console for more information. If you go that route, you need to use the results returned from this function and produce useful output (such as a plot) yourself.</li>&#13;
<li>You could also modify this R function for your own purposes - though that requires R coding knowledge.</li>&#13;
<li>Some useful books which cover the material of this and most of the other apps (though often a somewhat more mathematical level) are <span class="citation">(Vynnycky and White 2010)</span> and <span class="citation">(Keeling and Rohani 2008)</span>.</li>&#13;
