## Overview {#shinytab1}
This app allows exploration of the ___Basic Virus Model___  in the presence of a drug. The idea is to explore the results for two hypothetical mechanisms of a drug. By comparing the model results with data, you can get hints as to the mechanism by which the drug might act. In this app, no explicit, statistical comparison to data (i.e. fitting to data) is implemented. Instead, you are asked to compare patterns obtained from the model and from real data qualitatively. The ___Influenza Drug Model___ app addresses a similar question and fits to data.

Read about the model in _The Model_ tab. Then, work through the tasks described in the _What To Do_ tab. Learn more about the model and its origins in the _Further Information_ tab.



### Learning Objectives
* Understand how one can compare models to data to learn about potential underlying mechanisms.
* Learn how to formulate models that represent different scientific hypotheses.
* Learn how both timing and strength of drug can impact infection outcomes.


## The Model {#shinytab2}

### Model Overview

This model is a variation of the basic virus model. A detailed description of the model can be found in the ___Basic Virus Model___ app. You should go through that app first. 

Here, we add drug treatment to the model in  the following ways:

* The drug can reduce the rate of infection for uninfected cells at a strength/efficacy given by the parameter _f_. This value is between 0 (completely ineffective) and 1 (100% effective).
* The drug can reduce production of progeny virus at a strength/efficacy given by the parameter _e_. This value is between 0 (completely ineffective) and 1 (100% effective).



### Model Diagram
The diagram illustrating this compartmental model is shown in the figure. The two new processes in which the drug can potentially work are indicated in color.


```{r modeldiagram,  fig.cap='Model Diagram',  echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = paste0("../media/",appsettings$modelfigname))
```


### Model Equations

Implementing this model as a continuous-time, deterministic model leads to the following set of ordinary differential equations: 


\begin{align}
\dot U & = n - d_U U - (1-f)bUV \\ 
\dot I & = (1-f)bUV - d_I I \\
\dot V & = (1-e)pI - d_V V - (1-f)gbUV
\end{align}


### Model Concepts

We'll be comparing our model results to data from hepatitis C virus- (HCV-) infected individuals who received interferon (IFN) treatment. The following figure from [@neumann98] shows the data we'll be referring to in some of the tasks. One often observes viral load kinetics following treatment that starts with a fast decline followed by a slower decline.

```{r, fig.cap='HCV virus load in patients following IFN treatment.',  echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('../media/hcvdata.png')
```




### Notes

* The drug is not explicitly modeled here, it is not given its own compartment/equation. Instead, we model the drug by its effects on some of the model parameters and assume that this effect is either absent or present but does not otherwise change with time. The ___Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics___ app provides a model that includes explicit modeling of drug uptake and decay.

* Efficacy and effectiveness are not *technically* the same measures, but, with respect to our computer simulations, we will use the terms interchangeably.

\nNow, set _Start at steady state_ to _yes_, confirm that all your variables stay at the steady state level they reached in the previous setting. Note that this will ignore the starting values for __U__, __I__ and __V__ and instead compute the steady state from the model parameters. If you need an introduction or refresher on what the steady state means and how one can compute it, see the ___Basic Virus Model___ app. 

\nNow, introduce a drug with 50% efficacy at reducing infection (i.e., _f_ = 0.5) on day 10. You should find that the system starts fluctuating after the drug is induced and then settles down at a new steady state with slighly lower virus load. You can confirm that this happens and the system reaches the new steady state no matter if you started in a steady state before giving the drug or not. 

\nNow assume that the drug instead reduces virus production by 50% (i.e., _e_ = 0.5), again starting the drug at day 10 (the exact day does actually not matter) and run it for 200 days. You'll see that the system again reaches a new steady state, this time with a much reduced virus load."

\nWe determined in the ___Basic Virus Model___ app the steady state value equation for the virus. Here, we can update that equation by simpliy adding _(1-f)_ in front of _b_ and _(1-e)_ in front of _p_. This gives $V_s = ((1-f)bn (1-e)p - (1-f)bd_Ign - d_I d_U d_V)/( (1-f) b d_I d_V)$. We can see that the _(1-e)_ term only shows up in the numerator, while the _(1-f)_ term affects both numerator and denominator, thus having overall less of an impact. Of course, it depends on the other model parameters. Play around with those model parameters and explore how that changes the impact of drugs that either reduce virus production or cell infection."

tasktext = "A model like this has been applied to study interferon treatment for Hepatitis C Virus [@neumann98]. (Today's standard of care for HCV generally does not involve interferon anymore, but it is still a useful example to consider.) One question the investigators wanted to answer is if one of the 2 mechanisms, i.e., reduction of cell infection (parameter _f_) or reduction of virus production (parameter _e_) is better at explaining/predicting observed viral kinetics. Let's try to explore this question.

\nSet starting conditions to 1e7 uninfected cells, no infected cells, and 10 virions. Set uninfected cell birth rate to 10000 and death rate to 0.001. Set the death rate of infected cells such that it corresponds to a lifespan of 5 days, virus clearance rate such that it corresponds to a virus lifespan of 4 hours, infection rate to 1e-7, virus production rate 100, conversion factor 1, and no treatment. Run simulation for 400 days with and without starting at steady state. Confirm that you end up with about 821667 virions at the end of the simulation. Plotting with y-axis on a log scale is likely best.

\nStarting at the steady state (chronic infection), run the simulation for 20 days and turn on treatment at 10 days. Try different strengths of treatment efficacy (values for parameters _f_ and _e_). It might be useful to plot the y-axis on a logarithmic scale to better see the virus kinetics. Compare the curve you see for the virus from the model to that seen in patients (see figure in _The Model_ tab). Based on that, which of the 2 drug action mechanisms would you predict is more likely to happen? Or do you need both mechanisms present? Or can neither reproduce a bi-phasic fast-then-slow virus load decline?"

## Further Information {#shinytab4}

This app (and all others) are structured such that the Shiny part (the graphical interface you see and the server-side function that goes with it) calls an underlying R script (or several) which runs the simulation for the model of interest and returns the results.
  
For this app, the underlying function running the simulation is called ``r appsettings$simfunction``. You can call them directly, without going through the shiny app. Use the `help()` command for more information on how to use the functions directly. If you go that route, you need to use the results returned from this function and produce useful output (such as a plot) yourself. 
  
You can also download all simulator functions and modify them for your own purposes.  Of course to modify these functions, you'll need to do some coding.
  
For examples on using the simulators directly and how to modify them, read the package vignette by typing `vignette('DSAIRM')` into the R console.
  
For some examples of models that were used to study antivirals in acute infections, specifically influenza, see e.g. [@handel07; @beauchemin08; @canini14a]. For some examples of models that were applied to antiviral treatment in chronic infections (HIV, HCV), see e.g. [@neumann98; @dixit04].
