## Overview {#shinytab1}
This app allows exploration of a model that is very similar to the ___Antiviral Treatment Model___ (which in turn is based on the ___Basic Virus Model___.) 

The new feature in this app is that the drug is explicitly modeled. Such models go by the name of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) models. Read about the model in _The Model_ tab. Then, work through the tasks described in the _What To Do_ tab.

### Learning Objectives
* Be familiar with a simple PK/PD model.
* Appreciate the impact different drug PK/PD can have on pathogen dynamics.

## The Model {#shinytab2}

### Model Overview

This model consists of 4 compartments modeling the basic dynamics of a viral infection in the presence of a drug. In this model, we track the following entities by assigning each to a compartment:

* **U** - uninfected cells 
* **I** - infected cells
* **V** - (free) virus
* **C** - drug concentration

In addition to specifying the ***compartments*** of a model, we need to specify the processes governing the model dynamics. For our system, we specify the following ***processes/flows***: 

1. Uninfected cells are produced at some rate _n_ and naturally die at some rate _d~U~_.
2. Virus infects cells at rate _b_, with unit conversion factor _g_.
3. Infected cells produce new virus at rate _p_ and die at rate _d~I~_.
4. Free virus is removed at rate _d~V~_ or goes on to infect further uninfected cells. 
5. Once treatment has started (_t_ > _t~xstart~_),  a new drug dose, __C~0~__, is administered at fixed time intervals, _t~interval~_, which increases __C__ at that time to __C__ + __C~0~__. This is modeled by an instantaneous increase. In between every dose, drug kinetics is modeled as decaying exponentially at rate *d~C~*. 
6. The efficacy of the drug, *e*, depends on the concentration of the drug, given by a so called Emax-equation. *E~max~* is the maximum efficacy at high drug concentration (and should be between 0 and 1), *C~50~* is the drug concentration at which the drug has half its maximum efficacy, and the parameter *k* dictates how rapidly efficacy increases as drug concentration increases.

### Model Diagram
The diagram illustrating this compartmental model is shown in the figure.

```{r modeldiagram,  fig.cap='Model Diagram',  echo=FALSE, out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = paste0("../media/",appsettings$modelfigname))
```


### Model Equations
Implementing this model as a continuous-time, deterministic model leads to the following set of ordinary differential equations: 


\begin{align}
\dot U & = n - d_U U - bUV \\
\dot I & = bUV - d_I I \\
\dot V & = (1-e)pI - d_V V - gb UV \\
\dot C & =  - d_C C, \qquad C=C+C_0 \textrm{ at } t = t_{interval}
\end{align}



*t~interval~* is the time at which a new drug dose is given. Prior to treatment start, i.e., _t_ < _t~xstart~_, there is no drug and **C** = 0. The drug efficacy _e_ is given by its own equation which depends on __C__ as follows:

$$e = E_{max} \frac{C^k}{C^k+C_{50}}$$



## What To Do {#shinytab3}

__The model is assumed to run in units of days.__

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}

tasktext = "For the first few tasks, we consider an acute viral infection and treatment (e.g. influenza and neuraminidase inhibitor drugs).  Set number of uninfected cells to 10^5^, 10 virions, no infected cells. We make the assumption that on the timescale of an acute infection (several days), the processes of natural, uninfected cell turnover are so slow that they can be ignored. Set values for the uninfected cell birth and death rates to reflect this assumption. Assume that infected cells have an average lifespan of 1 day, virus of 12 hours. Set virus production rate to 10, infection rate to 10^-5^ and conversion factor to 1. Start simulation at time 0 and run for 20 days. For the drug, assume treatment starts at day 10 and occurs daily thereafter at a dose of 1. Assume the drug decays at a rate of 1 per day. Set the concentration-dependent drug effect parameter to 1, the half maximum effect level to 1 and max drug efficacy to 0. Run the simulation. You should get 28694 infected cells at the peak and a max drug dose of 1.57. Since the drug levels are fairly low, you might need to plot the y-axis on a log scale and use plotly and zoom into the drug part to see it's up and down pattern."

\nBy reading off the values for the drug from the graph (or looking at the reported values below the graph), convince yourself that the peak drug concentration starts at 1 and slowly over the first few days increases to around 1.5. Now set the drug decay rate to 5. Convince yourself that the peak drug concentration does not go beyond 1, i.e. there is no build-up. Now, set _dC = 0.1_. You'll now see a build up to a concentration of almost 9.

\nNext, set drug decay rate back to _dC = 1_ and change treatment interval to 3 days. Run simulation and convince yourself that the drug concentration again does not really go above the administered dose of 1. Re-do for a decay rate of _dC = 0.1_.

tasktext = "Now, we'll explore the PD part of the model, i.e., the equation $e = E_{max} \\frac{C^k}{C^k+C_{50}}$, which describes the impact of the drug for a given drug concentration. Reset all inputs. Start treatment at day 2. Run the model for _E~max~ = 0_, you should get the same values as in task 1. 

\nNow, explore _E~max~_. Set it to 0.5, then 1. You should see a substantial increase in the impact of the drug, evidenced by higher uninfected number of cells remaining. You might habe noticed that by increasing _E~max~_, the infection is delayed, which is especially noticable for _E~max~ = 1_. To account for this, set the simulation time to 100 days, then run again for the 3 different _E~max~_ levels (0, 0.5, 1). You'll still find that an increased drug efficacy leads to fewer infected cells. Note that for the way we set up the model, the highest biologically reasonable value for _E~max~_ is 1, which means _e = 1_. While you can stick higher values into the model, they don't make any sense (you'd get negative virus production). Depending on how the model is formulated, _E~max~_ values above 1 could be possible.

\nNext, explore the parameter _k_ by running the simulation for values of 1, 2, and 3. Leave everything else as it is (i.e. _E~max~ = 1_, _tfinal = 100_). You'll find that it doesn't have much of an impact on the infection. Finally, we'll explore the _C~50~_ parameter. 

\nSet _k_ back to 1, and run the model for _C~50~_ values of 1, 0.1 and 10. You'll notice that this parameter has a strong impact.

\nTake a look at the remaining number of uninfected cells. Assume your goal was to prevent as many uninfected cells from getting infected as possible.

## Further Information {#shinytab4}

This app (and all others) are structured such that the Shiny part (the graphical interface you see and the server-side function that goes with it) calls an underlying R script (or several) which runs the simulation for the model of interest and returns the results.
  
For this app, the underlying function running the simulation is called ``r appsettings$simfunction``. You can call them directly, without going through the shiny app. Use the `help()` command for more information on how to use the functions directly. If you go that route, you need to use the results returned from this function and produce useful output (such as a plot) yourself. 
  
You can also download all simulator functions and modify them for your own purposes.  Of course to modify these functions, you'll need to do some coding.
  
For examples on using the simulators directly and how to modify them, read the package vignette by typing `vignette('DSAIRM')` into the R console.
  
If you want to learn a bit more about these kinds of models, see e.g. [@powers03; @talal06; @handel09b; @canini14a].
