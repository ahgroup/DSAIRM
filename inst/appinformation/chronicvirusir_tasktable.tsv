"DSAIRM_chronicvirusir"	"chronicvirusir"	"Chronic Virus and IR Model"	1	"Let's start by considering an acute viral infection. Set the initial conditions to 10^5^ uninfected cells, no infected cells, and 10 virus particles. We make the assumption that on the timescale of an acute infection (several days), the processes of natural, uninfected cell turnover are so slow that they can be ignored. Set values for the uninfected cell birth and death rates to reflect this assumption. Assume also that infected cells have an average life-span of 1 day, and virus has a life-span of 6 hours (remember that the inverse of the lifespan is the rate of death, and make sure you convert to the right units). Set that the virus production by an infected cell is 100 virions per day and that the rate at which new cells become infected is 10^-6^. Assume there is no need to do any unit adjustment/conversion (i.e. the value of that parameter is 1). 


Run the simulation for 50 days; produce plots with and without log-scales. You should get a single, acute infection with virus and infected cells rising at first and then declining. At the end you should be left with around 11069 uninfected cells and no infected cells or virus."

Contemplate what you expect to see, then run the simulation to compare. Keep increasing until you get essentially no more infection (i.e., < 1% initial uninfected cells become infected). You will have to adjust the simulation time for that, too."
