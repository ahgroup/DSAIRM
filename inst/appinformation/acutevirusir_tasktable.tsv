"DSAIRM_acutevirusir"	"acutevirusir"	"Acute Virus and IR Model"	1	"Let's start by considering infection dynamics in the absence of the immune response. Set the initial conditions to 10^5^ uninfected cells, no infected cells, and 10 virus particles. Assume also that infected cells have an average life-span of 1 day, and virus has a life-span of 6 hours (remember that the inverse of the lifespan is the rate of death, and make sure you convert to the right units). Set that the virus production by an infected cell is 100 virions per day and that the rate at which new cells become infected is 10^-6^. Assume there is no need to do any unit adjustment/conversion (i.e. the value of that parameter is 1). Set the starting values for the immune response variables ~F~ and ~T~ to 0, and also set the two immune response induction rates to 0. With those choices, the values for the other immune response related parameters do not matter. If you want, you can also set them all to 0. 
Run the simulation for 50 days; produce plots with and without log-scales. You should get a single, acute infection with virus and infected cells rising at first and then declining. At the end you should be left with around 11069 uninfected cells and essentially no infected cells or virus."

"DSAIRM_acutevirusir"	"acutevirusir"	"Acute Virus and IR Model"	2	"In the absence of the immune response, this model is the same as the one covered in the first part of the _Basic Virus_ app. Convince yourself that you can get at most one rise, then decline of virus, and confirm that this acute infection increases as you increase virus production and infection rates, and that it decreases as you increase infected and virus death rates. 
Run a simulation for 50 days with a doubling of virus production and infection rate (compared to the previous task), as well as a doubling of the lifespans of the infected cells and virus (remember the relation between durations, such as lifespan, and rates, such as death rates.)"

"DSAIRM_acutevirusir"	"acutevirusir"	"Acute Virus and IR Model"	3	"Now we'll turn on the immune response. Set everything as you did for the first task. Then change the starting value for ~T~ to 1, set ~r_T_~ = 0.01, ~d_T~ = 1 and ~k_T_~ = 0.01.  Run the simulation and convince yourself that in the absence of the innate response, the adaptive response is not triggered, and the resulting infection is thus like the one you saw in the previous tasks."

"DSAIRM_acutevirusir"	"acutevirusir"	"Acute Virus and IR Model"	4	"The previous task showed that in the absence of the innate response, the adaptive response won't kick in. The reverse is not true. Set everything back as in task 1. Then set the starting value for ~F~ to 1, ~r_F_~ = 0.01, ~d_F~ = 1 and ~k_F_~ = 0. With these settings, the innate response is activated, but has no impact yet on the virus kinetics. You should see the same virus and infected cell trajectories as for task 1. Now, turn on the action of the innate response by setting ~k_F_~ = 0.01."	"T4R1"	"Remaining uninfected cells at the end"	"Rounded_Integer"	"Report the rounded integer"
