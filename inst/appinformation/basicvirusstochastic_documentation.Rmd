## Overview {#shinytab1}
This app allows exploration of a stochastic model that is almost identical to the deterministic model introduced in the ___Basic Virus Model___ app. In fact, both models are being run so comparison is possible. Read about the model in _The Model_ tab. Then, work through the tasks described in the _What To Do_ tab.

### Learning Objectives
* Be familiar with stochastic compartmental models.
* Understand the advantages and disadvantages of stochastic models.



## The Model {#shinytab2}


### Model Overview
This model consists of 3 compartments and is almost identical to the deterministic basic virus infection model. We track the following entities, by assigning each to a compartment:

* **U** - uninfected cells 
* **I** - infected cells
* **V** - (free) virus


In addition to specifying the ***compartments*** of a model, we need to specify the dynamics determining the changes for each compartment. Broadly speaking, there are ***processes*** that increase the numbers in a given compartment/stage, and processes that lead to a reduction. 

For this model, we consider the following processes: 

1. Uninfected cells are produced at some rate _n_ and naturally die at some rate _d~U~_.
2. Virus infects cells at rate _b_.
3. Infected cells produce new virus at rate _p_ and die at rate _d~I~_.
4. Free virus is removed at rate _d~V~_ or goes on to infect further uninfected cells. 




### Model Diagram
The diagram illustrating this compartmental model is shown in the figure (with $g=1$ for this model).


```{r modeldiagram,  fig.cap='Model Diagram',  echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = paste0("../media/",appsettings$modelfigname))
```


### Model Equations
If we were to implement this model as a continuous-time, deterministic model, it would have the following set of ordinary differential equations: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot U & = n - d_U U - bUV \\
\dot I & = bUV - d_I I \\
\dot V & = pI - d_V V - b UV
\end{aligned}
$$

### Model Concepts

Instead of implementing a continuous-time, deterministic model via ordinary differential equations, we use a ***stochastic model*** here. For such a model, the differential equation formulation is not valid. One can write down an equivalent formulation as a stochastic model by specifying every possible process (also called transition/event/reaction) that can occur and their ***propensities*** (the propensity multiplied with the time step gives the probability that a given process/event/transition occurs). For our model these are the following:

Event type              |  Transitions                     |   Propensity      |
----------              |  -----------                     |   ----------      |
Production of U         |  U => U+1                        |   n*U             |
death/removal of U      |  U => U-1                        |   d~U~*U          |
infection               |  U => U-1, V => V-1, I => I+1    |   b\*U*V          |
death if I              |  I => I-1                        |   d~I~*I          |
production of V         |  V => V+1                        |   p*I             |
removal of V            |  V => V-1                        |   d~V~*V          | 


### Notes

* The one difference to the deterministic virus model is that we do not include an additional conversion factor to account for experimental units. The reason is that this stochastic model makes the assumption that all entities/variables are in discrete units, i.e., the number of cells and number of (infectious) virions, and can only change by integer numbers. Because of that, our model requires that virus is in units of actual virion numbers and we don't need to convert. That also means that the parameter _g_ of the deterministic model - which we run for comparison - is set to 1.

* The `adaptivetau` package/function we use to run the stochastic model does not allow specification of starting time and time step. It always starts at *t=0* and each time step is chosen by the simulation routine based on the adaptivetau algorithm. Therefore, to allow comparison with the ODE, the start time for the ODE is fixed to 0. Also, the time step at which data is returned is fixed at tfinal/1000.

You should get an infection. 

\nNow, set _Models to run_ to both. You should get infections from each model; however, they look somewhat different. The infection produced by the stochastic model takes off faster. It also leads to slightly more infected cells. Figure out how you can determine the total number of infected cells caused by the infection. Hint: The maximum number of infected cells is not the same as the total number. Another hint: Contemplate what happens to the uninfected cells, and therefore what the final value of the uninfected cells might tell you about the infected cells."

The maximum value for the virus for the stochastic simulations is around half that of the deterministic model. Based on the text below the plot, you know that the stochastic results are the averages over all runs. Thus, you are adding two values that are similar to the ODE model to 2 values that are 0. Reporting the average (mean) over situations that both do and don't lead to infection might not be too insightful. It might be better to report the number/fraction of times you get an infection, and then just the average for some quantities for those simulations where an infection occurs. For these settings, is it true that the average of the virus peak for the stochastic simulations is above that of the ODE? You might want to switch to plotly and zoom in on the peaks to determine this."

This does never happen for the deterministic model. If the infection starts with more virions, the chance of all of them going extinct is much less. Test that by starting with 5 initial virions, re-run the simulation. You should find 13 outbreaks/infections happening. Repeat for 10 virions. You can explore different random seeds and more simulations to convince yourself that an increase in initial virus leading to more infections is a robust result (and doesn't depend on specific choices of the random seed or number of samples)."

tasktext = "With the model settings we explored so far, stochasticity/randomness matters in deciding if an infection occurs or not. Once it has started, the resulting time-series look fairly smooth and not too noisy. The reason for that is that the numbers of virus grows quickly, and there are a lot of cells; thus, in general, the law of large numbers applies and the overall behavior of the system is fairly well approximated by a deterministic model. We can change this by reducing the number of cells. Reset all inputs. Then set U=1000. To make up for this change, increase b to b=0.002. Run 20 simulations of the stochastic model. You will see that the time-series look much noisier, even at the peak. You should find that 4 simulations produce an infection. Record the average number of peak/maximum infected cells.

The important take-home message from this is that for small numbers (e.g., at the start or end of an infection, or when overall numbers are large), stochasticity is often important. Once numbers are fairly large (100s or more), then deterministic models are usually doing a good job describing the system dynamics."

## Further Information {#shinytab4}
This app (and all others) are structured such that the Shiny part (the graphical interface you see and the server-side function that goes with it) calls an underlying R script (or several) which runs the simulation for the model of interest and returns the results.
  
For this app, the underlying functions running the simulation are called ``r appsettings$simfunction[1]`` and ``r appsettings$simfunction[2]``. You can call them directly, without going through the shiny app. Use the `help()` command for more information on how to use the functions directly. If you go that route, you need to use the results returned from this function and produce useful output (such as a plot) yourself. 
  
You can also download all simulator functions and modify them for your own purposes.  Of course to modify these functions, you'll need to do some coding.
  
For examples on using the simulators directly and how to modify them, read the package vignette by typing `vignette('DSAIRM')` into the R console.
