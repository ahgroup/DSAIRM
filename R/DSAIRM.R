#' DSAIRM: A package to learn about Dynamical Systems Approaches to
#' Immune Response Modeling
#'
#' This package provides a number of Shiny apps that simulate various
#' within-host infection and immune response dynamics models.
#' By manipulating the models and working
#' through the instructions provided within the Shiny UI, you can learn about
#' some important concepts in immune response modeling. You will also
#' learn how models can be used to study such concepts.
#'
#' Start the main menu of the package by calling dsairmmenu().
